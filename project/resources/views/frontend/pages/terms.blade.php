      update the product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.

    </p>

    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Your rights if we suspend the supply of products:</span>

      We will contact you in advance to tell you we will be suspending supply of the product, unless the
      problem is urgent or
      an emergency. If we have to suspend the product for longer than 30 days we will adjust the price so
      that you do not pay
      for products while they are suspended. You may contact us to end the contract for a product if we
      suspend it, or tell
      you we are going to suspend it, in each case for a period of more than 30 days and we will refund
      any sums you have paid
      in advance for the product in respect of the period after you end the contract.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">We may also suspend supply of the products if you do not
        pay.</span>
      If you do not pay us for the products when you are supposed to (see clause 4) and you still do not
      make payment within 7
      days of us reminding you that payment is due, we may suspend supply of the products until you have
      paid us the
      outstanding amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending supply of the products. We
      will not suspend the
      products where you dispute the unpaid invoice (see clause 10.6). We will not charge you for the
      products during the
      period for which they are suspended. As well as suspending the products we can also charge you
      interest on your overdue
      payments (see clause 10.5).

    <h4 id="section_title">Your rights to end the contract</h4>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">You can always end your contract with us.

      wrong with it, how
      we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have

      </span>

      be subject to
      deductions and you will have to pay the costs of return of any goods;


    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">In all other cases
      </span>
      (if we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind), see clause 6.

      refund you in full for any products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to
      compensation. The
      reasons are:


    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text">we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you
      have ordered and you do not wish to
      proceed; there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events
      outside our control;
      we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to
      suspend them for technical
      reasons, in each case for a period of more than 30 days; or
      you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts
        Regulations 2013).
      </span>
      For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and
      receive a refund. These
      rights, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, are explained in more detail in these terms.


    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Our goodwill guarantee.

      </span>
      Please note, these terms reflect the goodwill guarantee offered by BOSS DRINKS LTD of BOSS DRINKS
      LTD,3/5 Ripple
      Road,Barking,Essex IG11 7ND, UK to its UK customers, which is more generous than your legal rights
      under the Consumer
      Contracts Regulations in the ways set out below. This goodwill guarantee does not affect your legal
      rights in relation
      to faulty or misdescribed products (see clause 2):

      be in their original unused condition,
      returned in their original packaging with a copy of the original delivery note provided.</p>

    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">How long do I have to change my mind?

      </span>
      You have 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the goods, <span id="span_1">unless your goods
        are split into
        several deliveries over different days.</span> In this case you have until 14 days after the day

        right to change your mind.

      </span>
      Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind (see clause 1), you can
      still end the
      contract before it is completed, but you may have to pay us compensation. A contract for goods is
      completed when the
      product is delivered and paid for. If you want to end the contract in these circumstances, just
      contact us to let us
      know. The contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid by you for products not
      provided but we may
      deduct from that refund (or, if you have not made an advance payment, charge you) reasonable
      compensation for the net
      costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.

      received them, you must
      return them to us. You must either return the goods in person to where you bought them, arrange for
      them to be returned
      to our registered address at BOSS DRINKS LTD,3/5 Ripple Road, Barking, Essex IG11 7ND, UK or allow
      us to collect them

      within 30 days of
      telling us you wish to end the contract.

    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">When we will pay the costs of return.
      </span>
      We will only pay the costs of return:<br>
      if the products are faulty or misdescribed;<br>
      if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or
      these terms, an error in
      pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a
      legal right to do so
      as a result of something we have done wrong; or<br>
      In all other circumstances (including where you are exercising your right to change your mind) you
      must pay the costs of
      return.



    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">What we charge for collection.
      </span>
      . If you are responsible for the costs of return and we are collecting the product from you, we will
      charge you the
      direct cost to us of collection. The costs of collection will be the same as our charges for
      standard delivery, see our
      delivery policy.




    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">How we will refund you.
      </span>
      We will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you
      used for payment.
      However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.




    </p>

    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Deductions from refunds.
      </span>
      If you are exercising your right to change your mind:<br>
      We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the
      value of the goods, if
      this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we
      refund you the price
      paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an
      unacceptable way, you must
      pay us an appropriate amount.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of
        delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer.
      </span>
      For example, if we offer delivery of a product within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have
      the product
      delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for
      the cheaper delivery
      option.

    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">When your refund will be made.
      </span>
      We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible. If you are exercising your right to change
      your mind then your
      refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if
      earlier, the day on
      which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us.

    <h4 id="section_title">Price and payment</h4>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Where to find the price for the product.</span>

      The price of the product (which includes VAT) will be the price indicated on the order pages when
      you placed your order.
      We use our best efforts to ensure that the price of the product advised to you is correct. However
      please see clause 3
      for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the product you order.
      We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT. If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and
      the date we supply
      the product, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the
      product in full before
      the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.

    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">What happens if we got the price wrong.</span>

      . It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be
      incorrectly priced. We will
      normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product’s correct price at your
      order date is less
      than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product’s correct
      price at your order
      date is higher than the price stated in our price list, we will contact you for your instructions
      before we accept your
      order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and
      could reasonably have
      been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid
      and require the
      return of any goods provided to you.

    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">When you must pay and how you must pay.</span>

      We accept payment by all major credit and debit cards. You must pay for the products before we
      dispatch them. We will
      not charge you for the products until we dispatch them to you.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">We can charge interest if you pay late.</span>

      If you do not make any payment to us by the due date we may charge interest to you on the overdue
      amount at the rate of
      1.5% a year above the base lending rate of HSBC Bank Plc from time to time. This interest shall
      accrue on a daily basis
      from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after
      judgment. You must pay
      us interest together with any overdue amount.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">What to do if you think an invoice is wrong.</span>


      If you think an invoice is wrong please contact us promptly to let us know and we will not charge
      you interest until we
      have resolved the issue.
    </p>


    <h4 id="section_title">Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</h4>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage
        caused by us.</span>


      If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a
      foreseeable result of
      our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not
      responsible for any loss or
      damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will
      happen or if, at the
      time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it
      with us during the
      sales process.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">We are not liable for business losses.</span>

      We only supply the products for domestic and private use. If you use the products for any
      commercial, business or
      re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business
      interruption, or
      loss of business opportunity.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section_title">How we may use your personal information</h4>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">How we will use your personal information.</span><br>

      We will use the personal information you provide to us in accordance with our <a id="email_text">privacy and cookies policy</a>. Please read
      these carefully.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section_title">Other important terms</h4>

    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">We may transfer this agreement to someone else.</span>
      We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation.

    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone
        else</span>
      (except that you can always transfer our guarantee). You may only transfer your rights or your
      obligations under these
      terms to another person if we agree to this in writing. However, you may transfer our guarantee at
      clause 4 to a person
      who has acquired the product. We may require the person to whom the guarantee is transferred to
      provide reasonable
      evidence that they are now the owner of the relevant item or property.

    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Nobody else has any rights under this contract</span>

      (except someone you pass your guarantee on to). This contract is between you and us. No other person
      shall have any
      rights to enforce any of its terms, except as explained in clause 2 in respect of our guarantee.
      Neither of us will need
      to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these
      terms.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will
        continue in force.</span>
      Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority
      decides that any of them
      are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
    </p>
    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still
        enforce it later.</span>
      If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if
      we delay in taking
      steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have
      to do those things
      and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a
      payment and we do not
      chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a
      later date.
    </p>

    <p id="agreement_text"><span id="span_1">Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal
        proceedings.</span>
      These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the
      products in the English
      courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either
      the Scottish or the
      English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the
      products in either the
      Northern Irish or the English courts.

    <p id="agreement_text">We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses,

      may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services

      relevant for you (we call this marketing).
      You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or
      purchased goods from us
      and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. We will get your express
      opt-in consent before we

      which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge

      To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
      sensitivity of the
      personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data,
      the purposes for
      which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,

      where you have
      successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
      your information
      unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
      however, that we may not
      always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
