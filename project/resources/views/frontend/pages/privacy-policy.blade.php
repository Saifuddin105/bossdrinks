    <p id="agreement_text">We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses,

        advertising. We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on

        relevant for you (we call this marketing).
        You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or

    <h4 id="section_title">7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h4>
    <p id="regular_p">We may share your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in some
        instances to process your order or
        carry out our services. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar
        degree of protection
        is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
    <p id="regular_p">• We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to
        provide an adequate level of protection
        for personal data by the European Commission.</p>
    <p id="regular_p">• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by
        the European Commission which give
        personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</p>
    <p id="regular_p">• Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are
        part of the Privacy Shield which
        requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
    </p>
    <p id="regular_p">Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us
        when transferring your personal
        data out of the EEA</p>


    <h4 id="section_title">8. DATA SECURITY</h4>

    <p id="agreement_text">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data
        from being accidentally lost, used or
        accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal
        data to those
        employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
        only process your
        personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
    <p id="regular_p">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and
        will notify you and any applicable
        regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>



    <h4 id="section_title">9. DATA RETENTION</h4>
    <p id="thrid_tnc_subtext">How long will you use my personal data for?</p>
    <p id="agreement_text">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the
        purposes
        we collected it for, including
        for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
        sensitivity of the
        personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data,
        the purposes for
        which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
        and the applicable
        legal requirements.
        By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial
        and Transaction
        Data) for six years after they cease being customers.
        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see paragraph 10 below for further
        information.
    </p>


    <h4 id="section_title">10. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>
    <p id="agreement_text">Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in
        relation to your personal data. In
        particular, you have the right to:</p>


    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Request access</span>
        to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to
        receive a copy of the
        personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Request correction</span>
        of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
        data we hold about
        you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Request erasure</span>
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is
        no good reason for us
        continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data
        where you have
        successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
        your information
        unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
        however, that we may not
        always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
        notified to you, if
        applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Object to processing</span>
        of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
        there is something
        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
        feel it impacts on
        your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
        personal data for
        direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate
        grounds to process your
        information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Request restriction of processing</span>
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in
        the following
        scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
        unlawful but you do not
        want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you
        need it to establish,
        exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
        verify whether we have
        overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Request the transfer</span>
        of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have
        chosen, your
        personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only
        applies to automated
        information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
        perform a contract
        with you.</p>
    <p id="coockies_p"><span id="span_1">• Withdraw consent at any time</span>
        where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
        lawfulness of any
        processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
        able to provide
        certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
        your consent.
        If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
